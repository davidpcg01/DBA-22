# DBA-22

Database Management Project

# PROJECT OVERVIEW

This repository contains one of my MSC independent projects for DSA-4513 Database Management course. A high-level description is as follows:

I am desiging a database for MyProducts Inc. This database captures different employee designations with PII, education and compensation. Each employee has different work functions in the manufacturing and QA process. We are also tracking the different product types produced, accounts for tracking costs and customer tables to track purchases, returns, and complaints/fixes. A full description is found in `Individual Project-CORRECTED Version Online CS4513 F22.pdf` under `/description`

There are 5 key tasks:

* Task 1 - Create ER diagram to represent relational database for the problem description
* Task 2 - Draw Schema diagram showing dependency relationships of all FKs in RDB designed
* Task 3 - Discuss Appropriate Storage structures for each relational table with search index key and justifications. Also discuss storage structures in Azure SQL database
* Task 4 - Create Database in Azure SQL, complete with all relation tables, PKs and FK dependency constraints matching Task 1 & 2
* Task 5 - Write queries to answer 15 business related questions, and develop a Java application that uses JDBC to connect to the Azure SQL to retrieve the results
* Task 6 - Test program created in Task 5 using generic table inserts and queries
* Task 7 - Create Web application using JSP to take user input and call the Java application which retrieves answers from Azure SQL and displays them
